Exam: Suppose you create a new branch named `bipulBranch`. So your code will be-
```ruby

```
### git push a specific branch-
```ruby
git push origin [Branch Name]
```
### Switched to another branch -
```ruby
gut checkout [branch name]
```
### To update code from Github to vs code-
```ruby
git pull
```
#### N.B: In this case, git pull command only pulls from the main branch.
### To pull from a specific branch -
```ruby
git pull origin [Branch Name]
